# InfectionSimulator
by Ryan Knight

## Software
Simple, visual viral spread simulator. I made this for my Year 2 Bioinformatics skills group project at the University of York.
Not actively maintained, but build should be stable. Please get in touch if it breaks and I will repair it because I am somewhat attached to it.

## Tech/Framework 
Built using python 3, mostly object oriented. Requires Tkinter and Pygame.

## Installation and requirements
Install tkinter and pygame. Pygame could be installed from console with "python -m pip install -U pygame --user on" on windows systems.
Should only be compatible with windows systems. If needed I could take a look at adapting but it wasn't required to at the time.

## How to use
Software use detailed in enclosed Program User Guide PDF.
